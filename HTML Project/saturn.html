        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar 
        System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine 
        and a half times that of Earth.[27][28] It has an eighth the average density of 
        Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[29][30][31] Even though Saturn is almost 
        as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third the mass of Jupiter. Saturn orbits 
        the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of 29.45 
        years

        Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep 
        layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid 
        helium, and an outer layer of gas. Saturn has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia 
        crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current in the metallic hydrogen 
        layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is 
        weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth because of 
        Saturn's greater size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is about a twentieth that 
        of Jupiter.[32] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, 
        although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 
        kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).
        <br><br><br>
        The planet has a bright and extensive system of rings, composed mainly of ice 
        particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons[33] 
        orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named; these do not include the 
        hundreds of moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second 
        largest in the Solar System, is larger (and less massive) than the planet Mercury 
        and is the only moon in the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere.[34]
