    <h3>SUN</h3>
    <p>
        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. 
        It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated
        to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating
        the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared 
        radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most
        important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been a
        n object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central sub
        ject for astronomical research since antiquity.The Sun orbits the 
        Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. 
        From Earth, it is 1 astronomical unit (1.496Ã—108 km) or about
        8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi),
        109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth,
        making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly 
        three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest
        is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements,
        including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

        Yellow dwarf, though its light is actually white. It formed approximately 
        4.6 billion[a] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within 
        a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center,
        whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. 
        The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear 
        fusion in its core. Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 billion kilograms
        (kg) of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 billion kg of matter into energy.
        <br><br><br>
        About 4 to 7 billion years from now, when hydrogen 
        fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the point 
        where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium,
        its core will undergo a marked increase in density and 
        temperature which will cause its outer layers to expand, 
        eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. 
        This process will make the Sun large enough to render 
        Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years 
        from the present. After the red giant phase, models 
        suggest the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a 
        dense type of cooling star (a white dwarf), and no longer 
        produce energy by fusion, but it will still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion for perhaps trillions of years. After that, it is theorized to become a super dense black dwarf, giving off negligible energy.
