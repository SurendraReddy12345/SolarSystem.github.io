    <h3>Mercury</h3>
    <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. 
        In English, it is named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god 
        of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified
         as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. 
         The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events 
         that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, 
         has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi) and one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km
          or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an expansive 
        rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.
        Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are 
        in a 3:2 ratio. This relationship is called spin–orbit resonance, and sidereal 
        here means "relative to the stars". Consequently, one solar day (sunrise to sun
        rise) on Mercury lasts for around 176 Earth days: twice the planet's sidereal y
        ear. This means that one side of Mercury will remain in sunlight for one Mercuria
        n year of 88 Earth days; while during the next orbit, that side will be in
         darkness all the time until the next sunrise after another 88 Earth days.
        Combined with its high orbital eccentricity, the planet's surface has wide
        ly varying sunlight intensity and temperature, with the equatorial regions ranging 
        from −170 °C (−270 °F) at night to 420 °C (790 °F) during sunlight. Due to the very
         small axial tilt, the planet's poles are permanently shadowed. This strongly suggests
          that water ice could be present in the craters. Above the planet's surface is an 
          extremely tenuous exosphere and a faint magnetic

        field that is strong enough to deflect solar winds. Mercury has no natural satellite.
        As of the early 2020s, many broad details of Mercury's geological history are still
         under investigation or pending data from space probes. Like other planets in the 
         Solar System, Mercury was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. Its mantle 
         is highly homogeneous, which suggests that Mercury had a magma ocean early in its
          history, like the Moon. According to current models, Mercury may have a solid 
          silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid outer core, a deeper liquid core layer, 
          and a solid inner core. There are many competing hypotheses about Mercury's origins 
          and development, some of which incorporate collision with planetesimals and rock 
          vaporization.</p>
