    <h3>NEPTUNE</h3>
    <p>
        Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the 
        fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive 
        planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth and 
        slightly more massive, but denser and smaller, than fellow ice giant Uranus. 
        Being composed primarily of gases and liquids,[20] it has no well-defined solid 
        surface, and orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 
        astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after 
        the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, representing Neptune's 
        trident.[f]

        Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar 
        System that was found from mathematical predictions derived from indirect 
        observations rather than being initially observed by direct empirical observation, 
        when unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise 
        that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. 
        After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, 
        independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently 
        directly observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by Johann Gottfried Galle 
        within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, 
        was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining moons were 
        located telescopically until the 20th century.
        <br><br><br>
        The planet's distance from Earth gives it a small apparent size and is far from 
        the Sun, and is very dim, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes, 
        until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with 
        adaptive optics allowed for detailed observations. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, 
        when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to 
        have visited it.[21][22] Like the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere 
        is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and 
        possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of ices such as water, ammonia 
        and methane. Similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;
        [23] both planets are normally considered "ice giants" to distinguish them.[24] Along 
        with Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane in the outermost regions make Neptune 
        appear faintly blue.[25][26]
